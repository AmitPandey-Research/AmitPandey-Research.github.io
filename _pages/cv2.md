Projects
======
* Blue Whale detection
  * Developed a system to detect and identify Blue whales (endangered species). 
  Lighter, faster and Robust system giving an accuracy comparable to the system developed by Stanford University team.
  (To be submitted )

* Biometric Pattern Classification for Fasater Identification
  * Created a pipeline to classify finger print patters for downward task of Identification. It acted as preliminary step for reducing complexity of database search in the problem of automatic fingerprint matching . Because , if a query image can be classified with high accuracy, the subsequent matching algorithm only needs to compare stored images belonging to the same class.
  Explored SVM's capability of learning sparse high dimensional data. This paired with carefully picked image processing techniques gave results which are comparable to deep learning techniques.

  Improved speed of identification by more than 2x and accuracy by around 7% (over other non-dl techniques).  

* Scientific Document Summarization
  * Summarization of scientific articles is a widely studied problem. Incorporating the additional information like facets of research information along with the summaries of papers written by other papers citing it can be useful for the task of summarization. Citations contain meta-commentary and provide additional contextual information about a reference paper. Since the citances contain some specific excerpts of the paper depending on their use-case, identifying which exert in reference paper a particular citance is referring to is helpful. Thus defining the summarization task of the reference paper based on its citation papers along with using an abstract of the reference paper helps by providing additional contextual information.
