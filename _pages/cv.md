Work experience
======
* May 2020- Present: Researcher
  * CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad
  * Supervisor: Professor PJ Narayan
  Working on Computer Vision and Graphics under Professor P.J. Narayan. Work involves Neural rendering, ray tracing and 3D reconstruction of objects and scenes. Working on photo-realistic reconstructions and rendering of scenes from images using Deep Neural Networks. Currently working on NeRF(Neural Radiance fields) line of work. Implemented and reproduced results of several papers in neural rendering.


* Dec 2020-Present: Independent Study and Researcher
  * CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad
  Independent Study under Professor Avinash Sharma. Working on Realistic Human Body Reconstructions and Digital Humans.

* June - July 2020: Crew Member and Mentee
  * Microsoft
  * Mars Colonization Program
  Worked on Automated mars rover web game. Developed the game in Agent Centric way. Used shortest path-finding algorithms like Collaborative Learning Agents, A*, Dijkstra, Best first search, IDA*, Jump-Point Finders and their bi-directional forms to make the AI rover navigate the mars. Applied Travelling salesmen algorithm and made the AI agent render multiple destinations in the shortest path avoiding all obstacles. Built using Object Oriented programming cocepts. Used Jquery, Rafael.js, and HTML, CSS and javascript.

* Jan 2020- May 2020: Applied Deep Learning and Software Engineering Intern
  * Scrapshut
  Developed a web-app using Angular and Django where users can check genuineness of any site by providing it’s URL and get other user’s reviews along with predictions by DL model. Trained various Deep Learning models like LSTM, XGBoost and CNN on three datasets- Kaggle fake news net, Kaggle: getting real about fake news and Kaggle fake news Prediction. Also trained a passive aggressive classifier (online learning algorithm) and incorporated user-rated scraped reviews for real time prediction.

* Nov 2019- Jan 2020: RL Researcher
  * Robotics Research Centre
Worked on several SOTA RL algorithms in Robotics and Control under Professor Madhav Krishna.
Implemented algorithms from Monte-Carlo to PPO, TRPO, DDPG etc from scratch. Also used open AI gym, RLib, Vowpall wabbit and engines like Gazebo, Mojuco for control in robotics.
